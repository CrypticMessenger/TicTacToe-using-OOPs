## TicTacToe in Java using OOPs


Operations:
    - 1 : to choose P vs P mode.
    - 2 : to choose P vs C mode.

running program will prompt you to enter the character you want to use as your marker.
generally people choose 'X' and 'O'.

-   TicTacToe board format is :

    | 0 0  | 0 1  | 0 2  |
    | 1 0  | 1 1  | 1 2  |
    | 2 0  | 2 1  | 2 2  |

    so to access top-left cell you will input "0 0" in the terminal.
-   every instruction will get printed in terminal too as you run the program, so nothing to worry about.
-   Computer tries best move to avoid player winning, unless player is winning by 2 ways or computer is winninng in a chance. 
-   in the main java file, i made a class "coordinate", which store row number, column number, but i chose not to completely replace it everywhere where it can be replaced, because 
    it was making my code less readable.
-   Comments are present inside code to explain functionality of the methods and classes.
-   To run the program:
    : javac TicTacToe.java
    : java TicTacToe
